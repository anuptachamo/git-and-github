/**
 *  ? 4. how to add new branch and delete
        - git checkout <- branch name->    (to navigate)
        - git checkout -b <- new branch name-> (to create new branch)
        - git branch -d <- branch name->   (to delete branch)

        for example i am creating a new branch name called feature1
        you needed to follow these steps:
            - git checkout -b feature1 (new branch will be created)
            - git branch (to check in which branch you are)
            - git checkout main (this will change to main branch)
            - git push origin feature1 (this will push the code to the feature1 branch )
