/**
 *  ? 4. how to add new branch and delete
        - git checkout <- branch name->    (to navigate)
        - git checkout -b <- new branch name-> (to create new branch)
        - git branch -d <- branch name->   (to delete branch)

        for example i am creating a new branch name called feature1
        you needed to follow these steps:
            - git checkout -b feature1 (new branch will be created)
            - git branch (to check in which branch you are)
            - git checkout main (this will change to main branch)
            - git push origin feature1 (this will push the code to the feature1 branch )

 <!--NOTE
        While creating new branch we cannot directly push the code in the new branch,
        before pushing code you needed to write some new command code,
            
            step 1: while you writing a command git push, you will get (The current branch name has no upstream branch)
            step 2: After that you needed to write command code, git push --set-upstream origin (branch name),
            step 3: after running that command you can easily push new branch code
